*GraphQL, but for your lights*

## Why?
Because GraphQL is amazing and so is home automation and I'm not choosing between them you can't make me.

## Trying it out
First off, you need lights. The special kind you can control with your smartphone and pretend you're telekinetic. I get mine from [Philips](http://www2.meethue.com/en-us/products/?category=131159). I think you can use other types, but I've never tried.

Assuming you've got some lights, do these things:

1. Clone this repo
2. Install (`npm install` or `yarn install` or whatever the cool kids do these days)
3. Do `yarn register`. That'll poll your Hue bridge until you press the link button
4. `yarn build`
5. `yarn start` :tada:

Open your browser to `localhost:8080` and try some queries!

**Lazy person copy & paste**

```sh
git clone https://github.com/PsychoLlama/filament.git && cd filament
npm install

echo "Press the giant button on your Hue bridge"
npm run register
npm run build
npm start
```

### Notes

\[1\]: The alert state provided by the Hue API contains the last alert sent to the light and not its current state (i.e. whether an alert is active), so this isn't particularly useful.

\[2\]: Deleting lights [can be messy](https://developers.meethue.com/documentation/delete-devices-application-guidance) and we haven't needed it, so we haven't added this yet.
